
Project 1: 8 Puzzle Solver

An initial State for the puzzle is provided by the user.
The puzzle then solves for the goal state from the user's initial state
The puzzle solver uses a brute force algorithm as a result all the nodes are explored. 
The implementation also has a mechanism to remove repeated nodes during execution.

To run the code:
Change the directory on terminal using cd to the file location and use:
python -i 8puzzle.py
when prompted as: "Please enter the initial state for the puzzle:"
please enter the initial state as "528417036"

For the output files the Explored txt file: “Nodes.txt” will be generated
